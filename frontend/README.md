# Simulacra — Prototype Frontend (WP5)

NOTE: this is a small prototype frontend intended for local development and testing of the WP5 backend.

## Overview

This is a simple companion chat interface for the WP5 backend prototype platform. Built with Next.js and React, it allows a human user to connect to the chatroom simulation backend, authenticate with a participant token, and interact with AI agents in real-time.

## Quickstart
see main project [README.md](./README.md) for setup instructions.
