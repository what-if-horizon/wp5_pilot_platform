# Experimental settings: prompts + group makeup
#
# This file defines n agent prompt styles under [prompts.*] and
# n treatment groups under [groups.*]. Each group has a `makeup`
# inline-table specifying the proportion of agents that should be
# assigned to each prompt style. Proportions are relative and will be
# normalized to the number of agents in the simulation.
