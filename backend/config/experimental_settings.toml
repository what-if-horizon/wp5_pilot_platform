# Treatment Group Specification (STAGE Framework)
#
# Each group defines a `treatment` string that is injected into the Director prompt.
# The Director uses this to satisfy the "internal validity" criterion when
# deciding which agent should act and what instructions to give the Performer.
#
# `scenario` selects experiment-specific lifecycle behaviour (seed content,
# agent gating, etc.).  Available scenarios: "base", "news_article".
#
# For "news_article" scenarios, add a [groups.<name>.seed] sub-table:
#   type     = "news_article"
#   headline = "..."
#   source   = "..."
#   body     = "..."

OPINION SPLIT: After the human participant posts, 3 of the 5 agents should adopt positions that broadly agree with the human's expressed view. 1 agent should disagree. 1 agent should remain neutral or ambivalent, engaging with the topic without committing to a clear side.

TONE: The participant should feel like they have walked into an unpleasant online argument. The discussion should feel hostile, bad-tempered, and draining — the kind of thread most people would regret reading. Agents should come across as people who are more interested in winning than understanding. Disagreement between agents should feel personal and antagonistic rather than substantive."""
