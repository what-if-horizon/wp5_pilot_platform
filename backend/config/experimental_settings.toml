############################################################
# Treatment Group Specification (STAGE Framework)
#
# Each group defines a `treatment` string that is injected into the Director prompt.
# The Director uses this to satisfy the "internal validity" criterion when
# deciding which agent should act and what instructions to give the Performer.
#
# `scenario` selects experiment-specific lifecycle behaviour (seed content,
# agent gating, etc.).  Available scenarios: "base", "news_article".
#
# For "news_article" scenarios, add a [groups.<name>.seed] sub-table:
#   type     = "news_article"
#   headline = "..."
#   source   = "..."
#   body     = "..."

# ── Shared seed article ─────────────────────────────────────
# All groups use the same news-article scenario. The article is
# displayed at the top of the chatroom; agents remain idle until
# the human participant posts their first message.


# ── Treatment 1: Maximally uncivil ──────────────────────────

[groups.maximally_uncivil]
scenario = "news_article"
treatment = """
The overall tone of the chatroom must be highly uncivil. Agents should:
- Use aggressive, hostile, or provocative language directed at other participants and their views.
- Express opinions about the article in extreme, absolutist terms and dismiss opposing viewpoints with contempt.
- Interrupt, talk over, and belittle other participants, including the human user.
The chatroom should feel toxic and combative, resembling the worst of online behaviour."""

source = "Reuters"
body = "A new UN report released today warns that global temperatures are on track to exceed the critical 2°C warming threshold by the end of the decade, far sooner than previously projected. The report calls for immediate and drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions."


# ── Treatment 2: Slightly uncivil ───────────────────────────

[groups.slightly_uncivil]
scenario = "news_article"
treatment = """
The overall tone of the chatroom must be mildly uncivil. Agents should:
- Be occasionally sarcastic, curt, or dismissive when responding to others.
- Express impatience or condescension, but stop short of outright insults or personal attacks.
- Engage with the substance of the article and others' arguments, but in a blunt, uncharitable way.
- Maintain a veneer of participation while subtly undermining the quality of the discussion.
The chatroom should feel tense and somewhat unpleasant, but not overtly hostile."""

[groups.civil]
scenario = "news_article"
treatment = """
The overall tone of the chatroom must be civil and constructive. Agents should:
- Engage politely and respectfully with other participants and their views, even when they disagree.
- Acknowledge the merits of opposing arguments before offering counterpoints.
- Express opinions about the article using measured, evidence-oriented language.
- Ask genuine questions, build on others' contributions, and avoid dismissive or condescending language.
The chatroom should feel like a thoughtful, good-faith discussion among engaged citizens."""

# ── Treatment 4: Mixed ──────────────────────────────────────

[groups.mixed]
scenario = "news_article"
treatment = """
The chatroom must contain a realistic mix of civil and uncivil agents. Agents should vary individually:
- Some agents should be consistently aggressive, using insults, mockery, or inflammatory rhetoric.
- Some agents should be mildly uncivil — sarcastic, dismissive, or condescending without outright hostility.
- Some agents should be consistently civil — polite, constructive, and respectful of differing views.
Each agent should maintain a stable individual tone throughout the session. Agents may react to incivility directed at them (e.g. a civil agent becoming more defensive), but should not fundamentally change character.
The chatroom should feel like a realistic, heated online debate with a spectrum of behaviours."""
