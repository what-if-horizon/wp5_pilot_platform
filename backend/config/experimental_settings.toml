# Treatment Group Specification (STAGE Framework)
#
# Each group defines a `treatment` string that is injected into the Director prompt.
# The Director uses this to satisfy the "internal validity" criterion when
# deciding which agent should act and what instructions to give the Performer.
#
# `scenario` selects experiment-specific lifecycle behaviour (seed content,
# agent gating, etc.).  Available scenarios: "base", "news_article".
#
# For "news_article" scenarios, add a [groups.<name>.seed] sub-table:
#   type     = "news_article"
#   headline = "..."
#   source   = "..."
#   body     = "..."
