# Treatement Group Specification 

# This file defines n agent prompt templates under [prompts.*] and n treatment groups under [groups.*]. 
# Each group has a `makeup` inline-table specifying the proportion of agents that should be assigned to each prompt template. 
# Proportions are relative and will be normalized to the number of agents in the simulation.
# IMPORTANT: the prompt must include the placeholder `@name` which will be replaced with the agent's actual name at runtime.
# This ensures that the model is aware of which agent it is simulating.

# Add new agent prompts by adding another [prompts.<promptname>] table.
