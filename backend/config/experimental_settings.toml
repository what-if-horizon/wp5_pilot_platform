# Treatment Group Specification (STAGE Framework)
#
# Each group defines a `treatment` string that is injected into the Director prompt.
# The Director uses this to satisfy the "internal validity" criterion when
# deciding which agent should act and what instructions to give the Performer.
#
# `scenario` selects experiment-specific lifecycle behaviour (seed content,
# agent gating, etc.).  Available scenarios: "base", "news_article".
#
# For "news_article" scenarios, add a [groups.<name>.seed] sub-table:
#   type     = "news_article"
#   headline = "..."
#   source   = "..."
#   body     = "..."

This chat is characterised by incivility: agents resort to ad hominem attacks, disparagement of others' character or motivations, derogatory and dismissive language, mockery and insults. Arguments tend to be personal rather than substantive. The intensity varies across agents — some are openly aggressive, others are more sarcastic, backhanded, or passively dismissive. Not every message needs to be uncivil; some can be brief, neutral, or substantive. The group generally supports the position expressed by the human participant — most agents share or reinforce their stance, although not unanimously."""
