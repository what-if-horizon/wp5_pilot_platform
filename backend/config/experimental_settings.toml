# Treatement Group Specification 

# This file defines n agent prompt templates under [prompts.*] and n treatment groups under [groups.*]. 
# Each group has a `makeup` inline-table specifying the proportion of agents that should be assigned to each prompt template. 
# Proportions are relative and will be normalized to the number of agents in the simulation.
