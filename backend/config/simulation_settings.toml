# Simulation configuration values used by SimulationSession.


### SESSION SETTINGS ### 
# Reproducibility seed 
random_seed = 42
# - session_duration_minutes: max. duration of the simulation session in minutes
session_duration_minutes = 5

### AGENT SPACE ###
# - num_agents: total agents in the session (int)
num_agents = 5 
# - agent_names: corresponding list of agent names to instantiate (list of strings, length must match num_agents). 
agent_names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Lucy", "David"] 

### AGENT PACING ###
# - messages_per_minute: background message rate (int)
messages_per_minute = 5
# - user_response_probability: probability an agent responds when a user message is posted (float between 0 and 1)
user_response_probability = 1 

### AGENT RELATIONSHIPS ###
# - each agent starts with a randomized 'chattiness' score between 0 and 1, which is used to weight their likelihood of being selected to speak.
# - this is modulated by their 'attention' score, which starts at zero, increases when they speak or are addressed, and decays over time.
# - attention_decay: controls how quickly an agent's "attention" decays over time (float between 0 and 1)
attention_decay = 0.9 
# - attention_boost_speak: amount to boost an agent's "attention" when they speak (float between 0 and 1)
attention_boost_speak = 1.0
# - attention_boost_address: amount to boost an agent's "attention" when they are addressed (float between 0 and 1)
attention_boost_address = 0.5
# - min_weight_floor: minimum weight floor for agent selection (float between 0 and 1)
min_weight_floor = 0.01

### LLM PROMPTING SETTINGS ###
# - context_window_size: how many recent messages to include in prompts (int)
context_window_size = 10
# - llm_concurrency_limit: per-process limit of concurrent LLM requests (must be a positive integer > 0)
llm_concurrency_limit = 5
